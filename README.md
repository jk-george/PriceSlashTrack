# 📉 PriceSlashers - Sales Tracker

## ❓ Problem Statement 

Online shopping is becoming increasingly popular and widespread but often, shoppers miss out on excellent discounts or sales online because these deals sell out quickly. Without timely notifications, users may only realise a sale was happening after the product is no longer available.

## 🎯 Project Goal

To develop an automated data pipeline that tracks prices from e-commerce websites and notifies subscribed users of price drops or sales within three minutes of a price change. 

The project will include:
- A cloud-deployed pipeline that monitors product prices in real time.
- A user interface hosted on a Streamlit dashboard where users can:
  - Add websites or products to track.
  - Remove products from being tracked.
  - View current and historical price data.
  - Set price thresholds for notifications.
